WELCOME TO MY PORTFOLIO WEBSITE!
This was my very first project since beginning
my coding adventure in May 2018. Please feel
free to browse, make suggestions, contact me
if you'd like. I have a long road ahead of me before
I am fully comfortable with coding, but I am getting
there, and hope to apply for a junior developer position
soon. Thank you!
